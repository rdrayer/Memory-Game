# Memory-Game
Simple Memory Game using JS, HTML and CSS.


Acceptance criteria:
- Clicking a card should change the background color to be the color of the class it has.
- Users should only be able to change at most two cards at a time.
- Clicking on two matching cards should be a “match” — those cards should stay face up.
- When clicking two cards that are not a match, they should stay turned over for at least 1 second before they hide the color again.
- Make sure this works only if you click on two *different* cards — clicking the same card twice shouldn’t      count as a match!)
- Make sure that you can not click too quickly and guess more than two cards at a time.
